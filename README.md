This is a small Discord bot I am working on to learn a new library and gain experience reading documentation.

So far it doesn't do much, but here's some functionality I hope to add:
- Reaction roles
- Translations
- Onboarding (getting input from the user before they are allowed to enter the server in a private channel made for them)
- Private lobbies (creating a category upon request that the requesting user can invite people to)
